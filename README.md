# Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform

## Overview

The **Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform** is a web-based application that allows users to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate with peers in a learning environment. Modeled after community-driven platforms like Stack Overflow, this app enables users to accumulate reputation points based on their contributions, including asking questions, answering, and sharing ideas. The platform leverages **JWT authentication** for secure access and stores user and content data in **MongoDB**.

## Key Features

- üîë **User Authentication**  
  Secure user sign-up and login processes with JWT-based authentication for personalized access.

## Project Structure


### Client

The **client-side** of the application is built using **Next.js**, providing an interactive, user-friendly interface. It handles user interactions, displays data, and communicates with the server via RESTful APIs. The client utilizes **Redux** for efficient state management and leverages **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** to ensure that data is fetched on the server before the page is rendered, enhancing performance and SEO.

**Main Features:**
- **User Sign-Up and Login Forms**  
  Users can sign up, log in, and authenticate their sessions via JWT. Redux is used to manage the user state globally, ensuring consistency across components and reducing redundant API calls.

- **Interface for Posting and Answering Questions**  
  Users can create, view, and answer questions on the platform. When questions or answers are posted, they are reflected in the Redux store and UI in real-time, ensuring smooth interactions.

- **Upvote/Downvote Functionality**  
  Users can vote on questions and answers. Voting updates the state both locally via Redux and server-side via API calls, ensuring that vote counts are synced.

- **Idea Sharing and Commenting**  
  The platform allows users to share and comment on ideas. Redux helps maintain a dynamic state, enabling live updates to the idea lists and comment sections.

- **Profile Page Displaying User Activity and Reputation**  
  Each user has a profile that displays their activity, including questions asked, answers provided, and their reputation points. Data for the profile page is fetched server-side using **getServerSideProps** to 
  ensure the latest user information is available upon page load.


### Server

The **server-side** of the platform is built using **Spring Boot** with **Maven** and **JDK 23**, serving RESTful APIs for managing data and handling business logic. The server also supports **JWT authentication** to secure routes and ensure authorized access.

### Main Features:
- **User authentication using JWT tokens**  
  Secure user sign-up and login processes with JWT-based authentication for personalized access.
  
- **REST API for managing questions, answers, and ideas**  
  Exposes RESTful APIs to handle creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of questions, answers, and ideas.

- **Database interactions for storing and retrieving user data, questions, and ideas**  
  MongoDB is used to store all user data, questions, answers, ideas, and votes.

- **Voting logic to update reputation points**  
  Users can upvote or downvote questions, answers, and ideas. Reputation points are updated accordingly based on user interactions.

- **Search functionality for questions and ideas based on tags**  
  Users can search questions and ideas using tags to easily find relevant content.

- **Filtering functionalities**  
  Allows users to filter questions and ideas by tags, most recent, most upvoted, or user-specific contributions, improving content discovery.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js** and **npm** for client-side development.
- **Java JDK 23** and **Maven** for server-side development.
- **MongoDB** for the database.

### Setting Up the Server

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeForgeLabs/Peer2PeerLearning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. Install Maven dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

4. Make sure you have **JDK 23** installed and configure it in your IDE or terminal environment.

5. Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   ```

6. Start the Spring Boot server:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Setting Up the Client

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website:  
   [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. Install client dependencies:
